# Project-Sentiment-Analysis
* The project's aim is to analyse the given IMDB review and tell whether it conveys POSITIVE or NEGATIVE sentiment.
* To do this a neural network of 3 layers was build by us containing the INPUT, HIDDEN and OUTPUT layers.
* To run this clone the repository and extract the reviews.zip in the same folder, you will get the reviews.txt.
* Now run the **project.py** in Python IDLE or Spyder IDE, you will need numpy library for python also.
* Spyder IDE will show the process of training and testing more smoothly than the Python IDLE.
* Also we have documented the process of building this neural network in the project.ipynb.
* To open this you will need **Python3** and **JUPYTER** installed or you can open **project.html** to view a static version in a browser. Although in static view the executed code in cells in some casses may produce very lenthy list of data, just scroll down continuously if you get that type of problem.
