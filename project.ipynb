A perfectly neutral word – one that was used in exactly the same number of positive reviews as negative reviews – would be almost exactly 1. The `+1` add to the denominator slightly biases words toward negative, but it will be a tiny bias and we'll be ignoring words that are too close to neutral anyway.\n",

    "The ratios tell us which words are used more often in postive or negative reviews, but the specific values we've calculated are a bit difficult to work with. A very positive word like \"amazing\" has a value above 4, whereas a very negative word like \"terrible\" has a value around 0.18. Those values aren't easy to compare for a couple of reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Right now, 1 is considered neutral, but the absolute value of the postive-to-negative rations of very postive words is larger than the absolute value of the ratios for the very negative words. So there is no way to directly compare two numbers and see if one word conveys the same magnitude of positive sentiment as another word conveys negative sentiment. So we center all the values around netural so the absolute value from neutral of the postive-to-negative ratio for a word would indicate how much sentiment (positive or negative) that word conveys. \n",

    "Making the `SentimentNetwork` class more efficient by eliminating unnecessary multiplications and additions that occur during forward and backward propagation. To do that,we do the following:\n",
    "* Remove the `update_input_layer` function.\n",
    "* Modify `init_network`:\n",
    ">* we no longer need a separate input layer, so remove any mention of `self.layer_0`\n",
    ">* we will be dealing with the old hidden layer more directly, so creating `self.layer_1`, a two-dimensional matrix with shape 1 x hidden_nodes, with all values initialized to zero\n",
    "* Modify `train`:\n",
    ">* Change the name of the input parameter `training_reviews` to `training_reviews_raw`.\n",
    ">* At the beginning of the function, we want to preprocess our reviews to convert them to a list of indices (from `word2index`) that are actually used in the review.Our code should create a local `list` variable named `training_reviews` that should contain a `list` for each review in `training_reviews_raw`. Those lists should contain the indices for words found in the review.\n",
    ">* Remove call to `update_input_layer`\n",
    ">* Use `self`'s  `layer_1` instead of a local `layer_1` object.\n",
    ">* In the forward pass, replace the code that updates `layer_1` with new logic that only adds the weights for the indices used in the review.\n",
    ">* When updating `weights_0_1`, only update the individual weights that were used in the forward pass.\n",
    "* Modify `run`:\n",
    ">* Remove call to `update_input_layer` \n",
    ">* Use `self`'s  `layer_1` instead of a local `layer_1` object.\n",
    ">* Much like we did in `train`, we will need to pre-process the `review` so we can work with word indices, then update `layer_1` by adding weights for the indices used in the review."
